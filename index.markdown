*Write code for humans, not computers*

Software engineers tend to focus too much on the elegance of the code, micro-optimizations, and eliminating lines to the point of obfuscation.

In reality those are considred a *minor* improvement to software. I believe good programmers should focus on writing efficient, maintainable, shippable code.


**I am a software engineer**. I largely focus on enterprise software in cloud. In my carrer, I have built serverless applications from the ground up, cloudified monolith software, maintained services with over millions of customers, among other things.


This is largely a text-based website to collect my thoughts, share projects, and compile my work experience over the years.

**In this site, you will find:**

- Developer logs 
- Resume
- Contact information

Have a look around!
